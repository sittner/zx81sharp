# zx81sharp

This is essentially a redraw of Mahjongg's great [ZX81plus38](https://github.com/mahjongg2/ZX81plus38) project.
I've done it to be able to fix and modify some issues:

* fixed pinout of tape connectors CO2/CO3
* fixed CPU clock phase
* fixed position of connectors and mounting holes
* replaced USB power connector with  2.1/2.5 mm power plug
* simplified memory address decoder to allow full usage of RAM/ROM memory
* fixed video output sync latch to avoid ghost lines
